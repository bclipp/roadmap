# Golang Software Engineer Roadmap

At the beginning, this roadmap was written in [DOT language](roadmap.deprecated.dot) and converted by [Graphviz](https://graphviz.gitlab.io/download/).
But later it has been rewritten in [GraphML](roadmap.xml).

There is also [circle PNG version](data/roadmap.circle.png) and [markdown version](data/roadmap.md).

Improvements are welcomed.
