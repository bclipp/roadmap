# Golang Software Engineer Roadmap

This roadmap was written in [DOT language](roadmap.dot) and converted by [Graphviz](https://graphviz.gitlab.io/download/).
But later it has been rewritten in [GraphML](roadmap.graphml.xml).

There is also [circle PNG version](roadmap.circle.png) and [markdown version](roadmap.md).


Improvements are welcomed.
